We are interested in improving the getting started experience for screen reader users. 

Some questions about the survey:
- Who is the audience? Will some or all have used VS Code?
- What would the best format for the survey be? Input box, dropdown with options, scale 1-10, or a mix?

Which are the most useful VS Code:
- extensions
- settings
- commands
- audio cues
- If you think of the time when you set up VS Code, what could we do to make this experience smoother for you?
- How happy are you with the VS Code accessibility experience?
- Where would you add audio cues to VS Code, if anywhere?
- If you had a magic wand, what would you change about VS Code?
- What are the most accessible applications in your opinion?
