## Purpose

With a commitment to advancing the accessibility of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for those with visual impairments, the Accessible Computing Lab at the University of Illinois and the VSCode team at Microsoft have come together to form a synergistic partnership. We extend an open invitation to the community to join us in this important initiative, lending their expertise and engagement to make VSCode more accessible for all.

## Codespace

I have created a codespace for testing purpose.
